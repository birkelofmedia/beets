# Beets

Beets is a modded version of [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) with some new components that makes it suitable as an admin dashboard framework, such as a customizable collapsing sidebar.

If you have never used Bootstrap before, I strongly encurage you to try it out before trying Beets!
