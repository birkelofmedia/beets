# About
Beets CSS is a CSS addon-library that is dependent on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. You will have to install Bootstrap for this library to work.

The porpose of Beets CSS is to tweek Bootstrap and give it a somewhat newer feel and some new functions. Beside a number of subtle design changes there are new button types, callouts, cursor classes and dropdown functions. Please refer to the [documentation](https://jonasbirkelof.github.io/beets-css/latest) to learn more about what is different from the default Bootstrap experience.

Bootstrap is open source and because of that Beets CSS is also open source. On the projects [GitHub page](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-css) you can access all of the source files and tweek it yourself as you wish.
